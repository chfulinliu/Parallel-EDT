# Parallel-EDT
* A parallel implementation for the exact Euclidean Distance Transform.

* This is a combination of the ideas of "Parallel Banding Algorithm to Compute Exact Distance Transform with the GPU"(known as pba) and "A work efficient parallel algorithm for exact Euclidean Distance Transform".

* You need OpenCV to run the demo.
